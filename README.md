# Film Sage React-Native App (ios)
Full-Stack Application for GA Final Project
Project Time: 10 Days

Built By:

* Jose Carlos de la Colina Horta

* There is no link to the project as it has not been deployed to the app store.

## Description

The goal of this project was to build a Full-Stack and Full CRUD app using React Native that pulls data from Ruby on Rails and Postgres as the API.

This app was designed to allow film photography enthusiasts a way to keep track of their film shots and be able to refer to them later on. Each entry gets posted and gets shown under the My Photos tab. Each entry is also able to be updated or deleted from the database.  

Conditional logic is used for the mapping of MyPhotos as well as the addition to a photo url in the update section.

I chose to focus on learning a new technology so that I will be able to build new projects in the future using React Native.

This project truly tested my research and time management capabilities. At first, three days were involved in setting up  user authentication using tokens. Though this was functional, the raw psql routes that I would be using for the photos database would not be compatible and would've most likely led to many errors. This would've put in danger the ultimate goal to finish on the given timeline and I had to abandon that section.  

## Technologies Used

FlavorBase was built using JavaScript, React, Ruby on Rails, Ruby, Postgres, Node.js, HTML, CSS, Heroku, and Bootstrap.
The developer tools we used were Github, Zoom, Atom, Slack, and Google.

## Approach Taken

I started off with the user authentication. I miscalculated the time it would take me to do this and lost a few days because of it. This was a very important lesson.

Learning the different complications that can come up with a new technology led me to work on this project for 10-12 hours for the rest of the days. It was a great test to my working ability and persistence in project mode.

Though there are a number of optimizations that I would have liked to worked through, I was happy with the product as I would like to use the app for my personal film pictures.
